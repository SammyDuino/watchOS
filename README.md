# Watch 2.0

Welcome to Watch 2.0
This is the second rewrite of the code. It has lots of new features and it is almost ready for production. However, there are some design flaws. You may download this code and use it, however you must give me credit.
It requires a RTC, TinyScreen, Processer (with a battery of course), a case (optional) and the micro usb. I will post a link to all of these items eventually
